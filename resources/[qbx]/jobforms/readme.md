> This Script Was Made Because someone was selling a version of this with less features and Server Owners shouldn't have to spend money for such basic and simplistic code.

> I've also decided to MIT license this code, do whatever you want with it.

This Script is a fantastic way for players to apply for in-game jobs within their FiveM servers. This script allows players to fill out job applications in-game using a custom form that collects all the necessary information. Once the form is submitted, all the data is transferred via a webhook to a designated Discord channel, where it can
be reviewed and processed by the server staff.

Overall, the job application script for FiveM is a powerful and essential tool for servers that want to streamline their hiring process and provide a better user experience for job applicants.
