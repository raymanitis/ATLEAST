### `üå±` **| Planting**
Our script offers a unique planting system that allows players to grow unlimited plants *(or a set max amount in the config)*. With the ability to plant seeds, players can cultivate their own plants and harvest them for raw materials. Our planting system makes the complete map a potential farm, allowing players to grow plants in any location they choose (*Soil/Ground check can be enabled in the config*). Optional growth speed zones add a strategic layer to farming, making it a fun and engaging experience.

### `üß™` **| Processing Tables**
Our script features processing tables that allow players to transform raw materials into high-value drugs. Players can use these tables to create drugs themselves, adding a layer of complexity to the drug economy. The Tables can be placed anywhere on the map, making it easy for players to process their materials and create drugs. Every table can be configured in the config file, allowing server admins to customize the experience to fit their unique needs.

### `üí∞` **| Selling Drugs to NPCs**
Our script allows players to sell drugs to NPCs, creating a dynamic market environment. Players can sell their drugs to NPCs for a profit, enhancing the overall gameplay. This feature adds a layer of realism to the drug economy, making it a fun and engaging experience for players. The selling prices on selling zones can be configured in the config file.

### `üö¨` **| Takeable Drugs**
Our script offers takeable drugs that players can consume for various effects. Players can take drugs to enhance their gameplay experience, adding a layer of realism to the drug economy. The effects of the drugs can be configured in the config file.

### `üìä` **| Ingame Admin Menu**
Our script features an ingame admin menu that allows server admins to manage drugs and tables. Admins can use the menu view and manage all drugs and tables on the server, making it easy to keep track of everything. The admin menu can be accessed by typing `/drugadmin [plants/tables]` in the chat.

### `üîß` **| Fully Configurable**
Our script is fully configurable, allowing server admins to customize every aspect to fit their unique needs. From growth speed zones to selling prices, every aspect of the script can be configured in the config file.
