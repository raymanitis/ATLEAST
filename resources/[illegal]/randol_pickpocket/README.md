## Randolio: Pickpocketing

**ESX/QB/QBX supported with bridge.**

With the current hype of Prodigy RP 2.0 release, I know some weasel is going to make a pickpocketing script and slap it on tebex for like $15 when it honestly takes very minimal work. With my lack of motivation lately this was a easy, simple release for me to hopefully get back on the scripting grind. Enjoy.

**Quick Breakdown**:

* Must be facing the ped you're targetting and they can't be facing you.
* Add configurable cooldowns between pickpockets, police alerts and blacklisted jobs.
* Detection whilst pickpocketing to see if the ped is running, flees or the distance between you is substantial.
* GTA Zone based rewards. Each zone has a tier assigned (low, medium, high) which you can obviously change to suit your needs.
* Different rewards for each tier and also configurable cash rewards for each zone. By default I roll a 50/50 chance on whether it will be item based or cash reward.
* Failing to roll chance based loot will result in the ped pulling out a tazer and zapping you.

**Do not ask me for support unless it's BUG related. I see this as a decent base script for you to maybe implement minigames and/or a thieving xp system but I will not help you do it.**
