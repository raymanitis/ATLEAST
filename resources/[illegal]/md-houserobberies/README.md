<h1>Fivemerr</h1>
This is NOT a requirement but something I personally use and believe in.


- to integrate with fivemerr make sure you have  ```set fivemerrLogs "API_KEY"```   in your server.cfg
   
- Head to /server/bridge.lua and line 3 turn local logs = true
  
- profit

Why integrate with Fivemerr? Its a great place to store logs as it doesnt rely on discord webhooks and its far easier to search through

As well as a place to offload images and videos from fivem that doesnt rely on discord since discord API will be automatically deleting images and videos after a certain amount of time If you need an invite to their server look below
